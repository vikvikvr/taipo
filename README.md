### How it works 💡

Get a **sentence**, type it as fast as you can.
Look out for the **typos**, some letters will be replaced by random ones!
Mistakes will prevent you from continuing for a brief amount of time, impacting your overall time.

### Game modes 🕹

Try it out as a **guest**, just practice your skills without worrying about competition.

Feeling lucky? Sign In and join a **random opponent** for a 1 vs. 1 match. You will see in real time the progress of the other player.

Want to challenge someone specific? Get the code and share it **with a friend** so you can play together.

### Extra 🌟

Review your progress by taking a look at the **history of your matches**.
You will also be given useful **stats** so you can compare yourself against your friends.
