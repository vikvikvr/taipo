A multiplayer **typing game** that will take your mistakes to the next level.

The **rules** are simple: get a sentence, type it as fast as you can! But look out for the typos, some letters won't be the ones you expect...

**Built with** [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). Powered by [socket.io](https://socket.io/) living on an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server.

This **solo project** was built in **1 week**, from idea to delivery.

The goal was to experience a complete **development workflow**, making use of **modern technologies** and **best practices**.

### Gameplay ðŸ’¡

**Fast and realtime**, will require speed and reflexes. Players can see how well is their opponent doing.

**Multiplayer** functionality built with [socket.io](https://socket.io/).
All the game logic is handled on the [express](https://expressjs.com/) **server**, making cheating impossible.

### Social login

Users can **sign in** and register without the need to fill in any forms

**Authentication** is handled with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). [React router](https://reactrouter.com/) then prevents users that are not logged in from accessing certain screens.

### Game modes ðŸ•¹

Try it out as a **guest**, just practice your skills without worrying about competition.

Feeling lucky? Sign In and join a **random opponent** for a 1 vs. 1 match. You will see in real time the progress of the other player.

Want to challenge someone specific? Get the code and share it **with a friend** so you can play together.

### Todo ðŸ“ƒ

- [ ] **Leaderboard** functionality
- [ ] Implement **testing**, both back-end and front-end
- [ ] **Deployment**
