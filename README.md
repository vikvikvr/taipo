A **typing game** that takes your mistakes to the next level.

### How it works ðŸ’¡

Get a **sentence**, type it as fast as you can.
Look out for the **typos**, some letters will be replaced by random ones!
Mistakes will prevent you from continuing for a brief amount of time, impacting your overall time.
