A **typing game** that takes your mistakes to the next level.

### How it works 💡

Get a **sentence**, type it as fast as you can.
Look out for the **typos**, some letters will be replaced by random ones!
Mistakes will prevent you from continuing for a brief amount of time, impacting your overall time.

### Game modes 🕹

Try it out as a **guest**, just practice your skills without worrying about competition.

Feeling lucky? Sign In and join a **random opponent** for a 1 vs. 1 match. You will see in real time the progress of the other player.

Want to challenge someone specific? Get the code and share it **with a friend** so you can play together.

### Todo 📃

- [ ] Review your progress by taking a look at the **history of your matches**.
- [ ] You will also be given useful **stats** so you can compare yourself against your friends.

## For legacy ⌚

- Run `npm i` in both client/ and server/ folders
- take a look at `.env.example` for both
- take a look at the available scripts in both `package.json`
